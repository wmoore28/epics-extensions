# CONFIG_SITE

# Make any application-specific changes to the EPICS build
#   configuration variables in this file.
#
# Host/target specific settings can be specified in files named
#   CONFIG_SITE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#   CONFIG_SITE.Common.$(T_A)
#   CONFIG_SITE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)

# CHECK_RELEASE controls the consistency checking of the support
#   applications pointed to by the RELEASE* files.
# Normally CHECK_RELEASE should be set to YES.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to NO to disable checking completely.
# Set CHECK_RELEASE to WARN to perform consistency checking but
#   continue building anyway if conflicts are found.
CHECK_RELEASE = YES

# To install files into a location other than $(TOP) define
#   INSTALL_LOCATION here.
#INSTALL_LOCATION=</path/name/to/install/top>

# Attention developers: Do not edit the settings in this file!
#
# Create a file CONFIG_SITE.local containing your local settings, e.g.
#   INSTALL_LOCATION = /home/install/gateway/here

# If these tests are built in a directory under CA Gateway,
# use the following definitions:
-include $(TOP)/../../CONFIG_SITE.local
-include $(TOP)/../configure/CONFIG_SITE.local

# If you copied these tests from the CA Gateway to be built as a
# standalone TOP, add your settings to the appropriate CONFIG_SITE[.local],
# and use the following definitions instead:

#-include $(TOP)/../CONFIG_SITE.local
#-include $(TOP)/configure/CONFIG_SITE.local
